# Cellendipity
My first project on Github.
My first project in p5.js, a port of my first 'proper' project in Processing.
Started 19th Jan 2016.

Based on an idea which stubbornly resisted my powers of forgetfulness, and which I seemed unable to fully 'solve' using imagination alone: 
What would it look like if seperate, autonomous 'cells', having a single primary colour (red, blue, green) were allowed to collide and 'spawn' new cells, where the colour of the child was located between each of the parents on a colour wheel? Would it all turn brown in the end?

In 2015, I started to wonder if I should ask a sw-developer friend or colleague to 'make this thing for me' to satisfy my growing curiosity. At some point during the year, I started paying more attention to Processing, eventually wondering if I should have a go myself. I was greatly aided and inspired by the following books:
'Novelty Waves' by Matt Pearson
'Learning Processing, 2ns edition' by Daniel Shiffman
'The Nature of Code' by Daniel Shiffman
'Generative Art' by Matt Pearson
'Getting started with p5.js' by Lauren McCarthy, Casey Reas & Ben Fry.

I borrowed heavily on the following code-examples (and would like to publicly express my gratitude to their respective authors):
'BouncyBubbles' by Keith Peters
'CircleCollision' by Ira Greenberg
'EvolutionEcosystem' by Dan Shiffman

The first sketch which satisfied my original 'brief' is dated 6th March 2016. Along the way, new ideas have 'spawned' in rapid succession and I have tried my best to keep up. I realised I needed to learn p5.js in order to share this thing on the web. This in turn led to a need for some GUI to permit tweaking the variables, and not least, a robust & autonomous code which code live on as a stand-alone application.

I am currently trying to finalise this project, which is mainly about bugfixing and adding all the known 'tweakers' to the GUI (without succumbing to the temptation to find some new ones).
